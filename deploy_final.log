(node:9552) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///C:/Users/zerou/Documents/TORONTOEVENTS_ANTIGRAVITY/scripts/deploy-simple.ts is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to C:\Users\zerou\Documents\TORONTOEVENTS_ANTIGRAVITY\package.json.
