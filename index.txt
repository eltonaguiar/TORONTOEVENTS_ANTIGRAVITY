Her writing explores intricate textures and strong narrative arcs, often shaped by community and place.</p> <p>Irvine’s compositional voice draws from jazz, folk, classical, and global traditions, weaving them into contemporary frameworks. His projects, including the Sean Irvine 5tet and Kind Neighbours, showcase his versatility and commitment to lyrical storytelling.</p> <p>Together, Jones and Irvine craft music that is both deeply personal and widely resonant, offering fresh perspectives on modern jazz through original works created specifically for this collaboration.</p> <p><strong>About Monica Jones</strong></p> <p>Métis musician, composer, artist and music educator Monica Jones has always had a passion for music. Beginning her musical journey in childhood, she eventually gravitated towards the saxophone and graduated from Brandon University’s jazz program.</p> <p>As a saxophonist and vocalist, her rich tone, melodic sense and soulful vocals have earned her opportunities to perform with many high caliber bands including the Winnipeg Jazz Orchestra, The Ron Paley Big Band, The Dirty Catfish Brass Band, The Winnipeg Jazz Collective and Same Old Shtick. A composer as well, Monica is currently working on a commission for jazz orchestra to be premiered on March 8th with the Winnipeg Jazz Orchestra.</p> <p><strong>About Sean Irvine</strong></p> <p>Best known for their work across the woodwind family, Sean Irvine’s meditative approach to tone colour and musical language has led to performances alongside renowned acts such as the Dirty Catfish Brass Band, Don Amero, Ron Paley Big Band, Papa Mambo, Kiko Freitas, Jon Gordon, Jimmy Greene, and Scotty Barnhart. In addition to a wide range of session work, Irvine plays a central role in projects like Still Crazy: A Paul Simon Tribute, Big City All Star Band, Men in Cheap Suits, Flatland Soul Famous, and the Winnipeg Jazz Orchestra.</p> <p>Irvine is currently preparing for the release of their second album as co-leader, Sean Irvine and the Winnipeg Jazz Orchestra: The Forgotten Stories Suite—set for release in February 2026. Featuring all original compositions, the project reflects on the lived experiences of 2SLGBTQ+ individuals and their journeys toward acceptance and identity.</p> <p>-</p> <p><strong>Jazz at the Fort Garry Hotel is located in The Club Room on the lower level of The Fort Garry Hotel.

Taylor, calls up a wide spectrum of American vernacular music — from Archie Brownlee to the Staple Singers, and from singer-songwriters Van Morrison to Townes Van Zandt. After relocating from California to North Carolina, Taylor began to record material under the name Hiss Golden Messenger. Though his initial recordings featured only his voice and guitar recorded to a cheap cassette recorder, recent Hiss albums have incorporated horns, strings and choirs. “(Taylor's) songs are smart and complex enough to betray a bigger and more insane question: What makes a person happy?"</p>b:Tdb1,<p><strong>A Milestone Celebration</strong></p> <p>This season marks a decade of sparkling magic, our <strong>10th annual Winter Light Festival</strong> and we’re going bigger and brighter than ever.

In this class, you’ll learn how to stretch not just canvas but a variety of fabrics. Bring a fabric that holds a special memory and turn it into a unique textile background for a painting or collage, or use the materials we provide to practice. We’ll offer a wide selection of fabrics that can make your canvas frame the palette you never knew you needed.</p> <p> </p> <p>Painting on canvas doesn’t have to start from a blank slate. Give your art a creative background that makes your work even more expressive. You can bring materials you have a sentimental attachment to, like a baby’s shirt or a dress you’ve outgrown and no longer use. Fun textiles are everywhere, and they’re art in themselves. Using these as a background for your artwork can inspire a completely new and different style to work with. Mod Podge, acrylic paint, beadwork, and patchwork are just a few techniques we’ll discuss and explore in the workshop.</p> <p> <img src="https://doavub8d2uzrx.cloudfront.net/media/files/temp/31dfad27-747c-4c69-95b8-6a272110c09b/b97989aa-6d7.jpg" alt="" width="547" height="365"></p> <p> </p> <p>We all have seen the good old artists canvas that is prepped with gesso and ready to paint.

Grab two or three, and combine them into an entirely new piece using a fun collage technique to tie them all together. In this class you will learn exactly how to do this. </p> <p>While you craft, enjoy delicious café bites, festive cocktails, and cozy hot drinks to sip as you create. Snack boards can be purchased with your tickets and cocktails will be available all night. </p> <p> Art classes at Sammie's offers a vibrant and enriching environment where individuals can explore their creativity, develop new skills, and express themselves through various mediums.
